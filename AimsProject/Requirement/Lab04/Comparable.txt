- The class that should implement the "Comparable" interface approach is Media.
- We cannot override compareTo() method to reflect the ordering "by title then by cost" and "by cost then by title".
- We can not have two ordering rules of the item if we use this "Comparable" interface approach. Because "Comparable" only
allow us to use one comparison.
- Modify code:
  + Override compareTo() method in Media Class to sort by title:
     public int compareTo(Media o) {
		return this.title.compareTo(o.title);
	 }
  + Override compareTo() method in DigitalVideoDisc Class to sort by length:
     public int compareTo(DigitalVideoDisc o) {
		if (this.title.compareTo(o.title) == 0) {
			if (o.length - this.length == 0) {
				return (int) (o.cost - this.cost);
			}
			else {
				return o.length - this.length;
			}
		}
		else {
			return this.title.compareTo(o.title);
		}
	 }
