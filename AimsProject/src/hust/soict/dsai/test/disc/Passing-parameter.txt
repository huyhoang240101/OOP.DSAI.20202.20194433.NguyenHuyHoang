- Java is a Pass by Value programming language.
- After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) the title of these two objects still remain because the values passed 
to the method are copied from the objects jungleDVD and cinderellaDVD. Therefore, only the copied values are swapped. 
The actual values of the two objects still remain the same.
- After the call of changrTitle(jungleDVD,cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) the jungleDVD changed because this method use getter
and setter to access and modify the title of the object and then create a new object with the changed title.
